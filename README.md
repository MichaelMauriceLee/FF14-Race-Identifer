Real time object detection of races from the game Final Fantasy 14.

The frozen inference model was created by using Tensorflow's Object Detection API and retraining Google's faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28
model to detect any images on the computer screen of any character from Final Fantasy 14 and display the information of the character's race and gender on screen.
